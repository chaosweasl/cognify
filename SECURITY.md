# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Report security issues privately**

If you find a security vulnerability in Cognify, please **REPORT PRIVATELY to 17daniel.dev@gmail.com**. Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

We take security seriously and will respond to vulnerability reports within 48 hours.

### What Constitutes a Security Vulnerability

- Authentication bypass or privilege escalation
- SQL injection or database access vulnerabilities  
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) or code injection
- Exposure of sensitive user data or API keys
- Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
- Insecure direct object references
- Session management vulnerabilities
- Cryptographic weaknesses

### What Does Not Constitute a Security Vulnerability

- Missing security headers that don't lead to exploitation
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without proof of concept
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security issues
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- Issues requiring physical access to user devices

## Security Measures

### Data Protection

**User Data Ownership**
- All user study data belongs to the user
- Data is stored in user-isolated Supabase databases
- No sharing of user data between accounts
- Users can export all their data at any time

**API Key Security**
- User-provided AI API keys are stored securely in browser local storage
- API keys are never transmitted to our servers
- Users maintain full control of their AI service accounts
- No server-side caching of user API keys

**Database Security**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforce data isolation
- All database queries are user-scoped
- Foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity
- Prepared statements prevent SQL injection

### Authentication & Authorization

**Supabase Auth Integration**
- Industry-standard OAuth2 authentication flows
- JWT tokens with secure expiration policies
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Secure password reset flows

**Session Management**
- Automatic session expiration
- Secure cookie configuration
- Protection against session fixation
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection

### Input Validation & Sanitization

**Server-Side Validation**
- All API endpoints validate input server-side
- Type checking with TypeScript
- Input length and format validation
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries

**Client-Side Protection**
- React's built-in XSS protection
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Sanitization of user-generated content
- Safe handling of dynamic content rendering

### API Security

**Rate Limiting**
- API endpoints protected against abuse
- Per-user rate limiting on write operations
- Exponential backoff for failed requests
- Protection against brute force attacks

**Secure Communication**
- HTTPS required for all communications
- TLS 1.2+ encryption in transit
- Secure headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- Protection against man-in-the-middle attacks

### Infrastructure Security

**Deployment Security**
- Vercel deployment with security best practices
- Environment variable encryption
- Secure CI/CD pipelines
- Regular dependency updates

**Database Security**
- Supabase managed PostgreSQL
- Automatic security updates
- Network isolation and firewalls
- Regular backup and disaster recovery

## Privacy & Data Handling

### Data Collection

**Minimal Data Collection**
- Only collect data necessary for functionality
- No tracking of study habits for marketing
- No third-party analytics beyond basic usage
- User can delete account and all data

**Local Storage**
- AI API keys stored locally in browser
- User preferences cached locally
- No sensitive data in server logs
- Clear data retention policies

### Third-Party Services

**AI Service Integration**
- Users provide their own API keys
- No server-side AI processing
- Direct user-to-AI-service communication
- No logging of AI requests/responses

**Analytics & Monitoring**
- Vercel Analytics for performance monitoring
- No personally identifiable information
- Aggregated usage statistics only
- User can opt out of analytics

## Secure Development Practices

### Code Security

**Dependency Management**
- Regular security updates
- Vulnerability scanning with npm audit
- Minimal dependency footprint
- Trusted package sources only

**Code Quality**
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint with security rules
- Code review requirements
- Automated testing for security-critical paths

### Access Control

**Development Access**
- Limited development team access
- Multi-factor authentication required
- Regular access reviews
- Principle of least privilege

**Production Security**
- Separate development/production environments
- Restricted production access
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Secure deployment procedures

## Incident Response

### Response Timeline

1. **Immediate (0-1 hours)**: Acknowledge receipt of security report
2. **Assessment (1-24 hours)**: Evaluate severity and impact
3. **Response (24-72 hours)**: Implement fixes or mitigations
4. **Communication (72 hours)**: Notify affected users if necessary
5. **Post-mortem (1 week)**: Document lessons learned

### Communication

- Security issues are handled confidentially
- Users notified of security updates through app notifications
- Public disclosure only after fixes are deployed
- Credit given to security researchers when appropriate

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

Keep these environment variables secure and never commit to version control:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url

# Application Security
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=your_app_url
```

### Security Headers

Cognify implements security headers to protect against common attacks:

- `Content-Security-Policy`: Prevents XSS attacks
- `X-Frame-Options`: Prevents clickjacking
- `X-Content-Type-Options`: Prevents MIME sniffing
- `Referrer-Policy`: Controls referrer information
- `Permissions-Policy`: Restricts browser features

## Security Checklist for Developers

### Before Deployment

- [ ] All environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Database RLS policies tested and working
- [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
