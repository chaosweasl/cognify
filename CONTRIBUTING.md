## ‚ùå Areas We're NOT Accepting Contributions For

To maintain code quality and architectural consistency, we're **not accepting contributions** for:

- Core SRS (Spaced Repetition System) algorithm changes (unless well-documented and well-argued!)
- Database schema modifications
- Authentication system changes
- AI integration architecture
- Core application logic and business rules
- Major feature additions or architectural changes

## üìã Before Contributing

### 1. Check Existing Issues

- Browse [existing issues](https://github.com/chaosweasl/cognify/issues) to avoid duplicates
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Join discussions to understand requirements

### 2. Create an Issue First

For any non-trivial contribution:

- Create an issue describing your proposed change
- Wait for maintainer approval before starting work
- Discuss implementation approaches

### 3. Development Environment

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note**: Due to Cognify's sophisticated database schema and complex infrastructure requirements, local development setup is **not practical** for most contributors.

**We welcome contributions that don't require local development:**

- **üìù Documentation edits** (can be done directly on GitHub)
- **üé® Theme suggestions** (CSS snippets or design mockups)
- **üêõ Bug reports** (no setup needed)
- **üí° Feature suggestions** (through GitHub issues)
- **üåç Translations** (text-only contributions)

**For advanced contributors only** (contact maintainers first):

```bash
# Complex enterprise-grade setup required
# Requires sophisticated Supabase schema, RLS policies,
# custom authentication flows, and extensive environment configuration
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cognify.git
# ... extensive database setup and configuration required
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Contribution Guidelines
