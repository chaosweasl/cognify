TODO:

- add logic for validation of email and password (signup + signin)
- add a message to check email for confirmation
- limit signing in and out so the db doesnt get overwhelmed
- make the main page distribute the user to /login
- make /login redistribute users to /dashboard if they're signed in
- make a small settings page for users to upload pfps, change usernames and other stuff
- add an OAuth alternative for google & github

basically get authentication and users on point before moving further
