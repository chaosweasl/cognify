## üêû Enhancement: Add Zustand Store Reset for Reliable Data Refresh

**Summary:**
Currently, after editing or saving flashcards/projects, the UI relies on a query param (`refresh=1`) or a page reload to update the project/flashcard list. This is not always reliable and can require multiple reloads for components to sync.

**Proposed Solution:**
- Add a `reset` or `clear` method to all relevant Zustand stores (e.g., `useProjectsStore`, `useFlashcardsStore`, and any others managing user, settings, study, or notification state).
- After saving, updating, or deleting data in any part of the app (not just `/projects` or the editor), call the appropriate store's `reset` method to clear cached data.
- Ensure all pages and components that depend on shared state (dashboard, study, settings, notifications, etc.) re-fetch fresh data from the backend when the store is empty or reset.
- Remove reliance on the `refresh=1` query param for state sync throughout the app.

**Benefits:**
- More reliable and instant UI updates after edits
- No need for full page reloads or URL hacks
- Cleaner, more maintainable state management

**Steps to Implement:**
1. Add a `reset` method to each relevant Zustand store (set state to initial/default values).
2. Call the `reset` method after successful save/update/delete actions in editors or modals.
3. Update data-loading logic in all relevant pages and components (dashboard, study, settings, notifications, etc.) to re-fetch if store is empty/reset.
4. Remove or deprecate the use of `refresh=1` in navigation across the app.

**Expected:**
Project and flashcard lists always reflect the latest changes immediately after edits, with no manual reloads required.
