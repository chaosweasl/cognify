      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which of the following is the correct way to declare a variable in JavaScript?",
      "options": [
        "var myVariable = 'Hello';",
        "variable myVariable = 'Hello';",
        "declare myVariable = 'Hello';",
        "myVariable := 'Hello';"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,

    {
      "id": "q2",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What will be the output of: console.log(typeof null);",
      "options": ["'null'", "'undefined'", "'object'", "'boolean'"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "This is a well-known quirk in JavaScript. typeof null returns 'object', which is considered a bug in the language but is maintained for compatibility."

      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "JavaScript is a case-sensitive language.",
      "correctAnswer": true,

    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which method is used to add an element to the end of an array?",

    },
    {
      "id": "q6",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What does the '===' operator do in JavaScript?",
      "options": [
        "Assigns a value",
        "Compares values with type coercion",
        "Compares values and types without coercion",
        "Performs logical AND operation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The '===' operator performs strict equality comparison, checking both value and type without any type coercion."

      "question": "Arrays in JavaScript can contain elements of different data types.",

      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a primitive data type in JavaScript?",
      "options": ["string", "number", "array", "boolean"],
