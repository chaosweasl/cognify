# Cognify Codebase Review & Improvements

This document summarizes the comprehensive review and improvements made to the Cognify codebase to ensure it follows lightweight, maintainable, solo-dev friendly principles.

## Critical Issues Fixed âœ…

### 1. Database Constraint Error (Primary Issue)
**Problem**: `daily_study_stats` ON CONFLICT specification didn't match database constraints
```
ERROR: there is no unique or exclusion constraint matching the ON CONFLICT specification
```

**Root Cause**: Application code used `onConflict: "user_id,study_date"` but database has:
- Project stats: `UNIQUE (user_id, project_id, study_date)`  
- Global stats: `UNIQUE (user_id, study_date) WHERE (project_id IS NULL)`

**Solution**:
- âœ… Fixed `updateDailyStudyStats()` to set `project_id: null` for global stats
- âœ… Added `updateProjectDailyStudyStats()` for project-specific stats  
- âœ… Updated ON CONFLICT specifications to match actual constraints
- âœ… Centralized daily stats logic to eliminate code duplication
- âœ… Updated type definitions to include `project_id: string | null`

### 2. Over-engineered Type System  
**Problem**: Unused complex type system with 392 lines of branded types in `lib/types/index.ts`

**Solution**:
- âœ… Removed unused `lib/types/index.ts` (392 lines of complex branded types)
- âœ… Kept simple, functional `src/types/index.ts` that's actually used
- âœ… Eliminated over-engineering while maintaining type safety

## Code Quality Improvements âœ…

### Architecture Compliance
- âœ… **Lightweight**: Removed unused complex systems, kept simple patterns
- âœ… **Solo-Dev Friendly**: Clear file organization, consistent patterns
- âœ… **Maintainable**: Centralized logic, eliminated duplication
- âœ… **Functional**: Core SRS functionality works correctly

### TypeScript & Linting
- âœ… All TypeScript linting issues resolved
- âœ… No ESLint warnings or errors  
- âœ… Proper type safety maintained with simpler types

### Database & Schema
- âœ… Application code now matches database schema constraints
- âœ… Created `/migrations/` directory with documentation
- âœ… Both project-specific and global daily stats supported

## SM-2 Algorithm Review âœ…

The spaced repetition system implementation is **correctly implemented** and follows Anki principles:

- âœ… **Proper SM-2 Formula**: `EF' = EF + (0.1 - (5-q) * (0.08 + (5-q) * 0.02))`
- âœ… **4-button to SM-2 Mapping**: Correct linear mapping (0â†’0, 1â†’2, 2â†’4, 3â†’5)
- âœ… **Learning Steps**: Configurable learning progression
- âœ… **Ease Management**: Proper ease factor calculations and constraints
- âœ… **Daily Limits**: Per-project new card and review limits
- âœ… **Scheduling**: Correct interval calculations for all card states

## Codebase Analysis Summary

### âœ… Good Patterns Found
1. **Simple Cache System**: Lightweight TTL-based caching with Zustand
2. **Clean Component Structure**: Proper separation of Server/Client components  
3. **Efficient Hooks**: Cache-first data access patterns
4. **SM-2 Implementation**: Comprehensive, Anki-compatible algorithm
5. **Type Safety**: Simple but effective type system in use

### âœ… Improvements Made
1. **Removed Over-engineering**: Deleted unused complex type system
2. **Fixed Database Issues**: Proper constraint handling for daily stats
3. **Centralized Logic**: Eliminated code duplication in SRS utilities
4. **Documentation**: Added migration docs and code comments

### ðŸ”„ Remaining Work
The following items are ready for the next phase but didn't require immediate fixes:

1. **Error Handling**: Current validation system works but could be simplified further
2. **UI Testing**: Manual testing of user flows (blocked by environment access)
3. **Performance**: Current patterns are efficient for solo-dev scale
4. **Caching**: Current implementation is appropriate for the scale

## File Changes Summary

### Modified Files
- `lib/supabase/dailyStudyStats.ts` - Fixed constraints, added project-specific functions
- `lib/srs/SRSSession.ts` - Updated to use centralized daily stats functions
- `migrations/README.md` - Added migration documentation

### Removed Files  
- `lib/types/index.ts` - Removed unused 392-line complex type system

## Key Takeaways

1. **Database-Application Alignment**: Critical to ensure ON CONFLICT specifications match actual database constraints
2. **Avoid Over-engineering**: The unused complex type system demonstrated how features can grow beyond their utility
3. **Centralize Common Logic**: Duplicated database operations create maintenance burden and bugs
4. **Solo-Dev Focus**: Simple, working solutions are better than sophisticated ones for single-developer projects

## Next Steps for Production

The codebase is now ready for the reported study session error to be resolved. The main database constraint issue has been fixed, and the code follows lightweight, maintainable patterns suitable for solo development.

For future development:
1. Continue prioritizing simple solutions over complex ones
2. Maintain the centralized approach for database operations  
3. Keep the type system simple and functional
4. Test changes thoroughly in development before production deployment
